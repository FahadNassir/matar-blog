//         I&apos;m a filmmaker by training and a storyteller at heart. I hold an MFA in Cinematic Arts and an MA in Serial Storytelling. I&apos;m a Palestinian based in Dubai, where I teach media at the university level. And I believe&mdash;truly&mdash;that my soul cannot think without a picture.

// The story machine started when I was a little boy. I dreamt of different worlds&mdash;maybe because I wasn&apos;t happy with this one. I felt an urge to change something. Everything. Maybe even my own name, my fate, my story.

// I never felt in control. I didn&apos;t get to make choices. I wasn&apos;t allowed to make decisions.
// Born stateless, bullied at school, and raised without a passport, I wanted control over something&mdash;anything.
// So, I started creating my own world. On paper.

// I tried drawing it. But I couldn&apos;t picture it clearly. It always came out messy. Ugly.

// I tried music&mdash;failed. I couldn&apos;t commit.
// I tried soccer. I wasn&apos;t fast or fearless enough. I loved the game, but the ball scared me.
// In school, I broke the rules during comprehension sessions and invented new worlds with words. That thrill of writing, of escaping into fiction, took me higher than anything else. I usually scored 8 out of 10, but it was never about the score. It was about freedom.

// And then the story turned.

// In eighth grade, my best friend died.
// The call came suddenly, and I received it like a prank&mdash;how do you tell a child that his childhood friend is gone?
// In that moment, I aged a million years. I aged with sadness. With speechless grief.

// That&apos;s when I knew: writing wasn&apos;t a hobby&mdash;it was a mission.
// Something larger than life.

// But I kept failing.

// I carried failure like a second skin. In love, in life, in identity.
// I didn&apos;t understand why my name meant &quot;Proud Rain.&quot; I didn&apos;t feel proud. I didn&apos;t feel like rain. I felt like a drought.

// At 17, I failed three subjects in high school. My world dried up. My family stopped speaking to me. I was a disgrace.

// And yet&hellip; I dreamed simple dreams: to drive a car, enroll in a college course, fall in love.

// At 18, I stumbled upon a small booklet. It was poetry. And it saved me.

// The way Nizar Qabbani wrote about love and loss cracked something open inside me. His words&mdash;and mine&mdash;became medicine.

// That same year, I talked a friend out of ending his life.
// He had lost his soulmate.
// I had just found mine: words.

// I didn&apos;t know it yet, but I wasn&apos;t chasing a passion.
// I was healing.

// With every word I wrote, I stitched together years of brokenness. I breathed again. I wrote for ten years without stopping. I no longer cared about failure or success. I just kept going.

// And then, at 30, something strange happened:
// The wounds healed. But the writing never stopped.

// I thought I had grown up. But the child in me never did.

// I still saw the jasmine tree hanging outside the old house. I still climbed the stairs in memory.

// And one day, on a train in Germany, I had a moment of clarity:
// I want to write a book.

// Everything changed.

// What had I been doing for ten years?
// Running. Writing. Crying into pages. Trying to make films. Telling stories. Selling dreams to myself.

// But those stories saved my past&mdash;and helped me imagine a future.

// In 2017, while studying in Germany, I finally wrote that first book:
// The 28 Mansions of the Moon.
// I fell in love with the literary form.
// In 2019, I wrote The Pigeon Whisperer and a collection of novellas.
// Readers connected deeply with my work&mdash;and I finally understood why I wrote:

// Because stories let us reshape the world.
// They help us survive.
// They help us make meaning.

// Since then, writing novels has been a yes among so many no&apos;s.
// What began as an escape became the most real part of my life.

// Today, I write to explore life&apos;s hardest questions&mdash;not to answer them, but to open the doors they hide behind.

// I write to show that:

// We can design our own narratives.
// Passion finds us when we&apos;re ready.
// People may never fully understand us&mdash;and that&apos;s okay.
// Being broken is part of being alive.
// You don&apos;t need to apologize for tears.
// Art is the rain in the desert.
// Dreams are the only real things in life.
// So keep dreaming.

// Here I am&mdash;still that child, still dreaming.
// Still writing.
// Still healing.
// Still mesmerized by how beautiful life can be, even with its pain.
